# three-s

**three-s** is a simplified version of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), designed to understand the core concepts of cloud-based object storage systems. It provides a REST API for managing storage, enabling operations like creating buckets, uploading, retrieving, and deleting files, as well as handling metadata.

This project focuses on essential features to demonstrate RESTful API design, basic networking, and data management concepts.

## Features
- **Bucket Management**: Create, list, and delete storage buckets.
- **File Operations**: Upload, retrieve, and delete objects (files).
- **Object Metadata**: Store and manage file metadata (size, type, timestamps).
- **REST API**: HTTP-based API for client-server communication.
- **XML Responses**: All API responses adhere to the Amazon S3 XML format.
